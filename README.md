## Problem Description


People's eating habits are the most important factor for their health. It is necessary to consume healthy foods for a healthy life. Consumption frequency and consumption times are as important as the foods consumed in healthy eating habits. 

In the pandemic, many countries imposed restrictions and many people had to spend time at home for a long time. For this reason, people's daily routines have changed almost completely during this period. Some people's bedtime and other's leisure times differed from normal times. Accordingly, food habits and types of food consumed have changed.

The purpose of this study is to show the change in the food habits of people and the variety of food consumed in the pandemic in Turkey.
